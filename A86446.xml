            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118540:3"/>up towards the I≈øle of Wight; from whence we hear, that they bare up on the back-≈øide, and ≈øailed directly to Sir George Ay≈øcue, who were riding thirty miles off from Plymouth: And on the ≈øix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth in≈øtant, De-Witte their Admiral, with the re≈øt of his Men of War, even like a Grove of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, bore up with hoi≈øted and booming ≈øailes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South-Ea≈øt Sound, re≈øolving to act the Theatre of War upon that part of Neptune's Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in order thereunto, the Vice-Admiral of Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with twenty ≈øtout ≈øhips, and eleven Frigats, drew forth, and prepared them≈øelves for an A≈ø≈øault; which Sir George Ay≈øcue perceiving, gave imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Orders and In≈øtructions to all his Captains, to ply windward, and to receive their ≈øalutation, which was acted with ≈øuch a revengeful rage, that both parties being inflamed, re≈øolv'd to fight untill the one was tamed; in≈øomuch, that Sir George with the Rainbow, charged them quite through, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to go to the windward of all, received 40 broad ≈øides, and with great difficulty got off, onely with the lo≈øs of three men, and his Bolt-≈øplit. In the mid≈øt of this di≈øpute, the re≈øt of our ≈øhips were not ≈øilent; but each man acted with an irre≈øi≈øtable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and re≈øolution; And from four of the clock, till 8 at night, the fight was extream hot; Then Nights
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118540:3"/>≈øable Curtains being drawn the di≈øpute cea≈øed, and both fleets lay in a defen≈øive po≈øture again≈øt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with all their lights hanging forth. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict was maintained with great gallantry and re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution on both ≈øides; and great was the execution; for we have received great lo≈øs, the George and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure, being much ≈øhatter'd and torn, and for the pre≈øent unfit for ≈øervice; divers were rent limb from limb by the Canon-≈øhot; ≈øome had their arms ≈øhot off; others, their legs; among≈øt the re≈øt, valiant Captain Pack, (an excellent ≈øtout Sea-man) hath his leg ≈øhot off; Captain Li≈øle is wounded in the ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ≈øince dead; Capt. Clerk is ≈øaid to be ≈ølain, &amp; divers others. Sir George lo≈øt 12 men, be≈øides ≈øome wounded; and received 60 ≈øhot in her Hull; the Samp≈øon, Elizabeth, and divers others, received great lo≈øs, and many a ≈øtout Sea-man hath made the Sea his grave; and too too many (for the pre≈øent) lies langui≈øhing of their wounds.</p>
            <p>Yet notwith≈øtanding, the Hollander hath little cau≈øe to brag, for his lo≈øs is exceeding great, many of their ≈øhips are rent and torn; the Rear Admiral is ≈øunk, the Captain of Flu≈øhing, the Armes of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (beware the Body next) and three other gallant ≈øhips.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118540:4"/>
            <p>However, the Dutch-men re≈øolved not to decline engagement; but lay in a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive po≈øture till Tue≈øday morning; at which time, they hung forth their bloudy flag of defiance, on the Top-ma≈øt head; and gave ≈øundry Vollies from aboard, retaining them as Trophies of Victory; the which, did ≈øo exa≈øperate the ≈øpirits of the Engli≈øh, that a Councel of War was called, to con≈øult what to do, in further proceedings again≈øt the enemy, and it was unanimou≈øly re≈øolved by the ≈øaid Councel to ingage them again: Hereupon preparation was made, and after prayers, and ≈øeeking of God, for a ble≈ø≈øing upon their enterpri≈øe, the Admiral, with 33 Men of War, hoi≈øted ≈øail, and ≈øtood up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; and about one of the clock in the Afternoon, both Navies engaged, and for the ≈øpace of ≈øeven houres furiou≈øly was the fight maintained, and great execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118540:4"/>done on both ≈øides, e≈øpecially to the Hollanders; but the night drawing on, the di≈øpute ended: And this morning the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had given us the ≈ølip about ≈øix leagues; ≈øome of our ≈øhips are in pur≈øuit; others are, come into this Harbour, with wounded men.</p>
            <p>The five hundred men ≈øent from this Town to Sir George, deported them≈øelves with ≈øingular dexterity and courage, and were in the thicke≈øt of the Conflict; many of them are ≈ølain, and about 60 wounded.</p>
            <p>This hath been the bloudie≈øt Conflict that ever hapned between the two Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; and con≈øequently, 'tis but a begining of the Chaos of confu≈øion; for it is now too late to di≈øpute the Ground-work, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of bloud being drawn at large in undeniable Maximes: Yet I doubt not, but the Lord will perfect that Work which he
